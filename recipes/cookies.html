        <h3> Description </h3>
        <p> This chocolate chip cookie recipe makes dozens of delicious cookies with crisp edges and chewy middles loaded with chocolate chips! </p>

        <h3> Ingredients </h3>
            
        <ul>
            <li> 3 and 3/4 cups all-purpose flour</li>
            <li> 1 and 1/2 teaspoons of baking powder </li>
            <li> 1 and 1/2 teaspoons of kosher salt </li>
            <li> 1 and 1/4 teaspoons of baking soda </li>
            <li> 1 and 1/4 cups of unsalted butter, softened</li>
            <li> 1 and 1/4 cups of white sugar </li>
            <li> 1 cup light brown sugar </li>
            <li> 2 large eggs, at room temperature </li>
            <li> 2 teaspoons vanilla extract </li>
            <li> 1 (12 ounce) package of semisweet chocolate chips</li>
        </ul>

        <h3> Instructions </h3>
        <ol>
            <li> Whisk flour, baking powder, salt, and baking soda together in a medium bowl, and set aside. </li>
            <li> Beat butter and sugars together in the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with a paddle attachment on medium-high speed until light and fluffy, about 5 minutes. Add eggs one at a time, scraping down sides of bowl as necessary. Beat for an additional 3 minutes. Add vanilla and beat for 10 seconds.</li>
            <li> Reduce speed to low and gradually add in the flour mixture, blending just until combined. Fold in chocolate chips. </li>
            <li> Scoop 1 1/2-inch balls of dough 3 inches apart onto a parchment paper-lined baking sheet; freeze for 15 minutes. </li>
            <li> Meanwhile, preheat the oven to 450 degrees F (225 degrees C).</li>
            <li> Bake cookies in the preheated oven, rotating halfway through, until golden around the edges and slightly gooey inside, about 8 minutes. Let stand on the baking sheet for 4 to 5 minutes, then transfer to a cooling rack. </li>
        </ol>
